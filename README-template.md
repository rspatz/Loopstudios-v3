## Overview

With this project, I decided to take what was supposed to be a landing page for Loopstudios, a fictional Virtual Reality company, and turn it into a 6-page website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

First, I marked up the landing page with semantic HTML5, then I created the style sheet, reset the browser's styles, and created some custom CSS properties, then styled the different sections of the page with a mobile-first approach, using Flexbox. When I was satisfied with the page, I decided to build out pages from the other links, following the design established in the landing page, and adding new features to the project. I used free stock images from unsplash, optimized in Affinity Photo 2, and SVGs from Font Awesome. For the events page, I created a slideshow to showcase events, using Vanilla JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the second time I have tried to build out a website using a mobile-first approach. I'm used to building out the widescreen version first, followed by media queries for the mobile, so it sometimes felt odd, as if I was working backwards. I sometimes ran into issues where the mobile code took precedence over the desktop version, and it changed the design for the widescreen. I had fewer of those issues than I encountered when I tried it the first time, however. Sometimes I forgot that I had to declare 'display: flex' in the mobile version, then change the 'flex-direction' for the widescreen version.

This is also the first time I have taken a one-page project and turned it into a multi-page website with more features than were expected. I have completed many design courses at two colleges, so I felt confident taking the existing figma design and expanding it, and my initial experience with this was good. In a future job, if I'm handed off a figma design that isn't complete, I will feel confident that I can tackle the missing parts, because of my design skills, and this experience.
